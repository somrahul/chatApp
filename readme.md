Using pusher.js i did the following:
Starting out, user 1 should have a link on a screen that says
something to the extent of "Start chat with user 2". User 2 should
have a blank screen.
4.    When user click the start chat link, an invitation window, much
like Skype should instantly popup on user 2's screen where they can
accept or reject.
5.    If they reject, let user 1 know, if they accept open a real time
chat room between the two users where they can send messages to each
other and see an ongoing feed of the message.
6.    The state of the chatroom (if they are in a chat or not) when
the page reloads, does not need to be persistent.
